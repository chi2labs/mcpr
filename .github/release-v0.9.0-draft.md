We're excited to announce the first official release of mcpr - Model Context Protocol for R! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

mcpr enables R developers to expose their functions, resources, and entire packages through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing seamless integration with AI assistants like Claude Desktop. This package brings the power of R's statistical and data analysis capabilities directly to AI workflows.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ HTTP-Based Architecture
- Reliable HTTP transport for stable connections with Claude Desktop
- Support for multiple concurrent clients
- Easy testing with standard HTTP tools
- Robust error handling and JSON-RPC compliance

### ðŸŽ¨ Decorator System
Following patterns established by plumber, mcpr provides an intuitive decorator system:
- `@mcp_tool` - Expose functions as callable tools
- `@mcp_resource` - Provide data and information resources
- `@mcp_prompt` - Define reusable prompt templates

### ðŸ’» Flexible Server Creation
- **Programmatic API**: Create servers dynamically in R scripts
- **Decorator-based**: Annotate existing functions with minimal changes
- **Server Generation**: Generate standalone server packages

### ðŸ“š Comprehensive Documentation
- Detailed vignettes for creating servers and using decorators
- Extensive function documentation
- Real-world examples included

## Installation
